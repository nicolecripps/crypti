# Crypti – A Crypto-Focused Interactive Shell (In Development)

Crypti is an experimental, Python-based interactive shell designed around secure workflows and cryptographic operations. Its companion daemon, Cryptid, will manage keys, secrets, and encrypted pipelines, enabling safe and auditable execution of commands.

Crypti is currently in active development, and the project’s goal is to create a modern, secure, and user-friendly shell where encryption is a first-class citizen.

### Project Goals

- Interactive shell with secure defaults – make working in the terminal safer by default.
- Built-in encryption, decryption, and signing commands – simplify working with cryptographic data.
- Encrypted pipelines – enable safe data flow between commands.
- Cryptid daemon for key management and secure secret storage – manage ephemeral and persistent keys.
- Encrypted command history and environment variables – protect sensitive information.
- Extensible Python plugin system – allow easy addition of custom commands.
- Optional sandboxed execution of commands – provide safe execution for potentially risky operations.
- Modern, human-readable syntax – avoid legacy shell quirks and make commands clear.

### Vision

Crypti aims to be more than just a shell. It aspires to be a security-first command-line environment, where developers, sysadmins, and security-conscious users can work with encrypted data and manage secrets natively and intuitively.

> Note: Crypti is currently under active development. Features are planned and may be implemented incrementally. Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome.
